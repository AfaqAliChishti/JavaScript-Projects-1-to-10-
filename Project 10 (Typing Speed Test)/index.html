    <h1>TYPING SPEED TEST</h1>
    <div id="text">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Typing is an important skill in the modern world.
        Whether
        you are a student, a professional, or simply using a computer for personal tasks, typing speed and accuracy can
        save you a lot of time. The key to becoming a faster typist is consistent practice. At first, you should focus
        on accuracy, making sure that each word is typed correctly. Once you gain confidence, you can gradually increase
        your speed. Good posture and proper hand placement on the keyboard are also very important. Keep your back
        straight, relax your shoulders, and let your fingers rest on the home row keys. Do not look at the keyboard;
        instead, train your eyes to stay on the screen. With regular effort, you will notice steady improvement. Typing
        is like any other skillâ€”the more you practice, the better you get, and soon your fingers will fly across the
        keyboard with ease.</div>
